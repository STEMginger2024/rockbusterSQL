# Rockbuster Stealth LLC - Business Intelligence Project
Rockbuster Stealth, LLC, is a fictional movie rental company facing stiff competition from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu. They plan to digitize their rental offerings.

As a business intelligence analyst, my tasks were:
* Load all their data into a RDBMS (I used PostgreSQL)
* Use SQL to query the database
* Answer their business questions with the insights I found

I took the raw data I was given and turned it into actionable insights, providing Rockbuster with the confidence they needed to decide how to proceed.
